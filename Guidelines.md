# GameJam Guidelines - Using Unity and Wwise

2. [Coding (C#)](#Coding-(C#))
3. [Unity](#Unity)
4. [Unity UI](#Unity-UI)
## Git
- One feature branch -> One Unity scene
- Three `develop` branches :
	- `develop` : developers
	- `develop_art` : graphic designers
	- `develop_wwise` : sound designers
- Make sure your Editor project settings are set to `force text` for Asset Serialization
- Use  [this](https://pastebin.com/8pkAUhfW) `.gitignore` file
- When Merging feature branch to any `develop` branch, use this procedure : 
	1. Branch `ours` into `ours_copy`
	2. Merge `theirs` into `ours_copy`
	3. Open and build the Unity project, make sure everything is as excepted
	4. Merge `ours_copy` in `ours`, using `git merge branch_name -X theirs` if necessary
	5. Add new prefabs into desired scene where applicable
- You can use `git merge --abort` if you need to step back from a merge
## Coding (C#)
- Every class shall extend `MonoBehaviour`, no exceptions.
- Exposing class attributes to public is acceptable.
- When declaring a lot of attributes, sort them in sections highlighted by comment lines
- Document what public attributes shall be initialized by what GameObjects in Unity editor
- Where applicable, Coroutines that use `WaitForSeconds(float)` should use this pattern : 
`timer++;`
`yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.0f);`
- Avoid fancy Polymorphism
- Implement the singleton pattern as follow when only one instance of an object is needed (for instance, the GameManager class) :
```
public class GameManager : Monobehaviour {
	public static GameManager instance = null;
	
	public void Awake() {
		if (instance == null)
			instance = this;
		else if (instance != this)
	      	Destroy(gameObject);
	}
}
```
- When refering to a singleton, use `GameObject.FindObjectOfType<T>()` in `public void Start()` to retrieve the instance, try to not rely on editor initialization (drag and dropping a GameObject reference in a public attribute) where possible 
## Unity
- Every element of a scene should be in a prefab, even if there is only one instance of it
- When developing a scene element, only the **top level** GameObject should require attributes initialization from other GameObjects in the scene
-  All the child GameObjects should be retrieved using the `GetComponentInChildren<T>()` method
- **Parent** GameObjects use the **Children** methods, not the other way around
- Always keep an updated prefab version of your top level scene components
	1. Drag and drop the scene GameObject in the prefab folder
	2. Delete old one
	3. Rename new one as desired
- Organize the prefab folder into subcategories folder
- When creating a GameObject, dont forget to reset its transform component
## Unity UI
- Use empty GameObjects as containers for your UI elements
- Use a `Canvas Scaler` component in the top level UI GameObject with `UI Scale Mode` set to `Scale With Screen Size` 
- Use anchors to place the container GameObject, then adjust the contained GameObjects using the center anchor
- Try to refrain from using editor initialization when setting public attributes on UI Controllers script. Use the the `GameObject.FindObject` instead
